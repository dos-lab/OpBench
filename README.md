# OpBench
Based on TVM. Profiling op performance with many features.

# op based computation graph

operator execution time and heterogeneous resource efficiency are affected by many features, includes intra-op parallel implementation, resource usage and inter-op parallel sequence. Only considering them both can gain sufficient operator performance data.
